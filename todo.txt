TODO List
- Get data in a usable form -Nick -J
- Data Reader - Nick -J
- Come up with categories to plot -Grace
- Come up with default metrics, or statistical methods to find metrics for those
  categories   -Grace
- Establish classes
- Establish the Function maker
- Establish the plot generics
- Make it look pretty
- Document
- :3


METHODS
- default variables will be categorical in intervals for display in a starplot
  user defined variables will be established by asking for a function of one or
  more variables as an input, with warnings and suggestions if it did poorly


FUNCTIONS
- function help:  - Mostly J
  it tells them the form in which they should type the function, syntax etc, so
  that they can appropriately format it

- function maker:  - Mostly J
  create a function from an appropriate string

- function checker (hidden within the maker):  - Mostly J
  checks to make sure the function they gave is appropriate, and offers warnings
  and suggestions if it isnt

- a plot generic: -Matt
  arguments for variables to be used, and what type of plot to do
  plot.type(player, a vector of variables (optional))

- Data reader
  takes a user given CSV, and attempts to put it in a form our data can use,
  applied the Variable class to all of the data, and applies all of the
  variables to their players (MOSTLY FOR CLASS ASSIGNMENT)


CLASSES:
- Variable:
  are either taken from data raw, or made using a user defined function, can be
  plotted.
- Player class: - Nick
  a list of variables associated with a player
- Team class: - Nick
  a list of players associated with a team, and year
